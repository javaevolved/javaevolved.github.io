modernApproach: "ObjectInputFilter"
oldCode: |-
  // Dangerous: accepts any class
  ObjectInputStream ois =
      new ObjectInputStream(input);
  Object obj = ois.readObject();
  // deserialization attacks possible!
modernCode: |-
  ObjectInputFilter filter =
      ObjectInputFilter.Config
      .createFilter(
          "com.myapp.*;!*"
      );
  ois.setObjectInputFilter(filter);
  Object obj = ois.readObject();
summary: "Restrict which classes can be deserialized to prevent attacks."
explanation: "ObjectInputFilter lets you allowlist/denylist classes, limit object\
  \ graph depth, array sizes, and reference counts. This defends against deserialization\
  \ vulnerabilities without external libraries."
