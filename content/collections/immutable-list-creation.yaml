oldCode: |-
  List<String> list =
      Collections.unmodifiableList(
          new ArrayList<>(
              Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c")

summary: "Create immutable lists in one clean expression."
explanation: "List.of() creates a truly immutable list — no wrapping, no defensive\
  \ copy. It's null-hostile (rejects null elements) and structurally immutable. The\
  \ old way required three nested calls."
