summary: "Restrict which classes can extend a type — enabling exhaustive switches."
explanation: "Sealed classes define a closed set of subtypes. The compiler knows all\
  \ possible cases, enabling exhaustive pattern matching without a default branch.\
  \ Combined with records, they model algebraic data types."
