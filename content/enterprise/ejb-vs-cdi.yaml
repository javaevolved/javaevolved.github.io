summary: "Replace heavyweight EJBs with lightweight CDI beans for dependency injection\
  \ and transactions."
explanation: "CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) provides the same dependency\
  \ injection and transaction management as EJBs, but as plain Java classes with no\
  \ container-specific interfaces or superclasses. Scopes like @ApplicationScoped\
  \ and @RequestScoped control lifecycle, and @Transactional replaces mandatory EJB\
  \ transaction semantics."
