oldCode: |-
  // How many days between two dates?
  long diff = date2.getTime()
      - date1.getTime();
  long days = diff
      / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
  // ignores DST, leap seconds
modernCode: |-
  long days = ChronoUnit.DAYS
      .between(date1, date2);
  Period period = Period.between(
      date1, date2);
  Duration elapsed = Duration.between(
      time1, time2);
summary: "Calculate time differences with type-safe Duration and Period."
explanation: "Duration is for time-based amounts (hours, minutes, seconds). Period\
  \ is for date-based amounts (years, months, days). ChronoUnit.between() for simple\
  \ differences. All handle edge cases correctly."
